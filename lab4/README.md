# Lab 4 Questions

1. Explain using code examples what is meant by props and state in React JS?

In React JS, applications are divided into components, similar to web components but handled entirely by React's Virtual DOM 
Components are declarative ways of defining parts of a web application. Components are functions disguised as HTML tags.

Props: Props are objects passed into a component's constructor function. Props can then be accessed in the component to render external state of the application.
State: React uses state to allow components to internally track state within them. It is a declarative mechanism, using a constant value and a setter function to manipulate the state of components.

2. In functional programming, what does the term functor mean? Can you give an example in JavaScript?

In category theory, a functor is a mapping between categories, in the same way that a function is a mapping between sets.
In terms of computer science and programming, a function can take a certain type of input and return a different type of output. 
For example the isEven function would take an integer and return a boolean.
A functor is the next step up from this, the Array type is an example of a functor, since it can be constructed from any primitive or composite type 
i.e turning type T to type Array<T> 

3. We have looked at three kinds of asynchronous programming mechanisms, namely callbacks, promises and streams. Mention one advantage and one disadvantage of each type.



4. With the aid of a diagram and example code, describe the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Box Model and show how it can be used to space DOM elements



5. Detail how the browser loads and bootstraps a rich web application from an initial URL.
