# The most annoying extension I can think of

This extension is designed to be as annoying and inconvenient as possible
Features include: 
- Replacing all capital 'I' with lowercase 'l' and vice versa
- Randomizing the colour of every paragraph, list element and header
- Funny image replacements.
- Destroys most hyperlinks

Sites to try:

- github.com
- wikipedia.org

I found this extension to be progressively more infuriating as I was writing it and looking up docs in the process.
